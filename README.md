# Going green
This is a personal project. 
I'm designing a responsive website to help exploring various possibilities when you are planning green changes in your house or garden.
This is to get a better idea of what to expect, and decide if these changes are worth doing without checking various sources of information, as it would all be in one place.

To visit the website under construction: http://going-green.chezleskrus.com/


15/01/18: two languages working : FR and EN

29/01/18: change of unit working - chicken and water sections mostly done

05/02/18: add cookies to memorise the preferences and add a cookie policy

07/02/18: add 2 more colour themes and the possibility to switch from one another - to be revisited later

19/02/18: add solar panel section - save values on index page in local storage - save open panels onbeforeunload 

02/03/18: add new wireframes

04/03/18: improved accessibility after checking with WAVE, and tab navigation - add a skip content option

19/06/18: improved accessiblity after chrome dev tool audit, improve footer, and review design plan


**next steps:**
- prototype a different navigation to replace the 'Hamburger menu' on small screens by tab bars
- organise user research to assess the actual design and user needs (navigation - Grow and email sections)
- improve navigation
- work on the email results section
- work on the 'Grow your own' section
- improve error handling if needed (following usability testing)
- add more languages

## Design goals
- Ease of use for expert users but also for users with little experience of apps
- Give a green feel visual, but still accommodate colour-blind users
- Choice of French or English - and more
- Responsive website so you can use it on a mobile or a desktop

## Technical aspects
I'm using [**Bootstrap**](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/getting-started/) and a mobile first design approach.


The various components will be adapted so they look as good as possible on various screens sizes.


This is using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [EJS](http://www.ejs.co/), [Sails](https://sailsjs.com/get-started), [SASS](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass#d-npm--nodejs), [LESS](https://getbootstrap.com/2.0.4/less.html).
